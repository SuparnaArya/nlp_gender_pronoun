# Gender pronoun resolution using NLP

Our project seeks to tackle the gender bias in pronoun resolution, a significant concern within Natural Language Processing (NLP). In essence, this involves linking expressions to their corresponding entities, a critical part of NLP that enhances comprehension. Despite advances in this field, existing models often demonstrate gender bias, resulting in unequal performance across different genders.
Our central objective is to construct a system capable of evenly balanced performance, regardless of the pronoun's gender.

We used Python with BERT fine tuning to achieve the task on Gendered Ambiguous Pronouns (GAP) dataset by Google.
